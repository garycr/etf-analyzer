## Decision Records

### DEC-001: Workspace Tier Selection

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | DEC-001 |
| **Date** | 2026-09-10 |
| **Category** | Governance |
| **Decision** | Initialize workspace at Tier 1 — Small Team |
| **Policy** | Workspace Configuration (`.github/workspace-config.md`) |
| **Authority** | User (workspace creator) |
| **Accountable** | Architect (decision traceability custodian) |
| **Context** | Initial workspace scaffolding — tier determines governance depth, agent roster, and planning artifacts |
| **Alternatives** | Tier 1 (Small Team), Tier 2 (Multi-Project Team), Tier 3 (Enterprise Program Office) |
| **Consequences** | Governance, agents, and planning artifacts are configured for the selected tier |
| **Reasoning** | Template provides pre-configured governance depth matching team size and compliance needs; higher tiers add ceremony justified by coordination overhead |
| **Assumptions** | Team structure and compliance requirements match the selected tier for the project duration |
| **Invalidation** | If team grows beyond tier capacity or compliance requirements change, re-evaluate tier selection |
| **Status** | Active |
| **Linked Artifacts** | `.github/workspace-config.md`, RSN-001 |
